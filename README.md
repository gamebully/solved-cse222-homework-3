<strong><u>PART 1:</u></strong>

In this homework, reuse the same scenario of Homework 1 and implement the same system using several implementations of the List abstract data structure.

<ul>

 <li>You should complete the ArrayList and LinkedList implementations in the textbook.</li>

 <li>You should implement a HybridList class that keeps a LinkedList as a component and the elements stored in the LinkedList are ArrayLists. The number of elements in each ArrayList should be less than MAX_NUMBER. When the number of elements in an ArrayList exceeds MAX_NUMBER a new ArrayList should be generated in the LinkedList. When there is no element in an ArrayList it should be removed from the LinkedList.</li>

</ul>

Use

<ul>

 <li>LinkedList in the textbook for information about branches</li>

 <li>ArrayList in the textbook for users of the automation system</li>

 <li>HybridList you implemented for the furnitures <strong><u>PART 2:</u></strong></li>

</ul>

Analyze the time complexity (in most appropriate asymptotic notation) of all methods in your implementation of automation system for this homework. Attach the code just before its analysis.




<strong>RESTRICTIONS: </strong>

<ul>

 <li>Use ArrayList and LinkedList</li>

 <li>Can be only one main class in project</li>

 <li>Donâ€™t use any other third part library</li>

</ul>
